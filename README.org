* Intro
  A tutorial on how to configure a nice Emacs setup for coding in
Clojure, Elisp and text editing in Org mode.

* Features
  The goals of the customization are to make coding and editing as
  fast and efficient as possible.  This is achieved by:
+ minimizing removing the fingers from the home row
+ minimum number of keystrokes to run common commands

Other features:
+ Vi keybindings
+ Leader key, ala Spacemacs
+ Lisp/Clojure structural editing
+ Text menus
+ Magit
+ Elisp debugging

* Get started, packages

The first step is connecting Emacs to some package archives.  This is
where we get additional software to extend the features of Emacs.
Create the file and folder:

: ~/.emacs.d/init.el

put the following in it:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; ============= package archives ========
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu"   . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") t)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

;; ============== use package =============
(package-initialize)
(when (not package-archive-contents) (package-refresh-contents))
(if (not (package-installed-p 'use-package))
    (progn
      (package-refresh-contents) 
      (package-install 'use-package)))
(require 'use-package)
(setq use-package-always-ensure t)    ;; download packages if not already downloaded
#+END_SRC
* Evil

We need to be evil.  All seasoned programmers eventually realize the
wisdom of Vi keybindings.  With the Evil package we can have that in
Emacs too.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq gnutls-algorithm-priority "NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3")
(use-package evil)                      ; vi like key bindings
(evil-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

That ~setq gnutls-...~ is a bug workaround.

* Color Theme

The next most important thing...turn this screen black before my eyes
bleed!

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(load-theme 'wombat t)                  ; color theme
#+END_SRC

Now since I'm an old man, bump that font size:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 140 :family "DejaVu Sans Mono") 
#+END_SRC

* Desktop Mode

Now I don't want to keep having to open this file and
~.emacs.d/init.el~ so turn on desktop mode with:

#+BEGIN_SRC elsip
(desktop-save-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Okay, now we are finally getting somewhere!

* Leader Keys

Now to be efficient programmers we need to be able to run functions
very quickly and easily.  Leader keys were popularized by the
spacemacs customization of emacs.  The concept is to allow us to call
functions by simply hitting the spacebar when in ~normal~ mode of Vi.
Lets supercharge our spacebar now!

** winum

However we need to tell our spacebar to do something interesting.  One
thing I like to do is use the ~winum~ package.  What this allows you
to do is to hop from one window in emacs to another by just hitting
~SPC~ then the number of the window.  So lets install ~winum~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package winum)                     ; switch between buffers using numbers
(winum-mode)
#+END_SRC

Restart your emacs!  Ensure you have two windows open.  Now hit ~SPC 1~, then ~SPC 2~.  You can quickly switch between windows now!

** general

Now we can use the ~general~ package to redefine the spacebar to be
our leader key.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package general :config (general-evil-setup t)) 
#+END_SRC

Finally configure general:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(general-define-key
 :prefix "SPC"
 :states '(normal visual emacs motion)
 "" nil
 "1" 'winum-select-window-1
 "2" 'winum-select-window-2
 "3" 'winum-select-window-3
 "4" 'winum-select-window-4)
#+END_SRC

Git Tag: leader-key

What this says, is that ~SPC~ is the prefix key, it applies when we
are in the ~normal~ state (among others).  Then we have a list where
the item in quotes is the key that will be hit after ~SPC~, followed
by the command that should get run.

No need to restart, we can just evaluation that expression.  Go after
the final parenthesis of the ~general-define-key~ command, and do ~C-x
C-e~.  

* Magit

Magit lets us use git.  As programmers we need to use git, so lets
install that!

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package magit) 			; git integration
(use-package evil-magit)                ; vi bindings for magit
#+END_SRC

Configure general to use Magit:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
"g" (:ignore t :wk "Magit")
"gs" (magit-status :wk "magit status")
#+END_SRC

Git Tag: magit

Restart.

Now ~SPC g s~ gets you the magit status window! :)

* Hydras

Hydras allow you to build text based menus that call functions when
you hit the corresponding key.  Again efficiently and easily calling
functions will speed you up! 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package hydra)                     ; hydra menus
#+END_SRC

** Buffer Hydra Menu

Lets make our first Hydra:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defhydra hydra-buffers ()
  "
^^^       BUFFERS ^^^
^ Goto  ^ ^ Save  ^ ^ Misc  ^  
^-------^ ^-------^ ^-------^
_k_ prev  _s_ this  _d_ kill
_j_ next  _a_ all    
"
  ("j" next-buffer nil)
  ("k" previous-buffer nil)

  ("s" save-buffer nil)
  ("a" (lambda () (interactive) (save-some-buffers t)) nil :exit t)
  ("d" kill-this-buffer nil)

  ("q" nil "quit" :exit t :color pink))
#+END_SRC

Lets activate this hydra with ~SPC b~.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
"b" (hydra-buffers/body :wk ">BUFFERS<")
#+END_SRC

: GIT TAG: hydra

* Project Management   

A couple of other packages I like are projectile and helm.  Projectile
allows you to work with git managed projects.  Lets get that now.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
just added project to init.el
need to get SPC p f working
dunno if not include helm just yet...
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp


#+END_SRC
